## What is a Design Pattern?
Design patterns are tipical solutions for common problems on a software project.
You shouldn't find a pattern and copy it to your software.
The pattern itself is not a specific piece of code that you can just copy and paste, but a general concept to solve a specific problem.
You should follow the pattern details and implement a solution that adapts to your application.
